These are 2 recommender systems based on two tower architecture on Amazon_us_reviews & MovieLens datasets.

There are 6 steps to be done:
 - Load datasets from tensorflow_datasets library
 - Preprocessing with Keras Layers
 - Retrieval Task
 - KNN
 - Ranking Task
 - Deployment of artificial intelligence model using TF Serving

 In this project these Library are used:
 - tensorflow as tf
 - tensorflow-dataset as tfds
 - tensorflow-recommenders as tfrs

 Datasets:
 - movielens/100k-ratings
 - amazon_us_reviews/Watches_v1_00
